## Exercise Concepts

### Muscle & Muscle Groups

Muscle is a tissue composed of bundles of protein called muscle fibres.
These cells have a special property where they can contract and relax in response to electrical and chemical stimulation.
The contraction and relaxtion of muscles enables people to walk, run, dance, sing, eat, twerk, mime, fight, juggle, digest food, and more.

There are various kinds of muscles, but for exercising we mostly care about skeletal muscle[^1][^2]. See [How Your Muscles Change With Exercise (Institute of Human Anatomy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vXOq-aRtYY) for more details.

[^1]: We care about joints, too. But they are beyond the scope of this discussion. See [Bursae and Tendon Sheaths (Medicine LibreTexts)](https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Anatomy_and_Physiology_(Boundless)/8%3A_Joints/8.4%3A_Synovial_Joints/8.4C%3A_Bursae_and_Tendon_Sheaths) for physiology of particular joints, and see [Bruce Lee and the IsoChain (NoLimitSquad)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALaoOLumD4Y&t=1097s) for a particular technique for strengthening joints.

[^2]: We also care about neuromuscular adaption, but this is also beyond the scope of this discussion. See [Rate Coding Explained (The Movement System)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJLkrdozT6Q) for an introduction, and [Principles of Neural Science (Kandel et al. 2013)](https://archive.org/details/PrinciplesOfNeuralScienceFifthKANDEL/page/n9/mode/2up), Chapter 34 on Motor Units, for more detail.

Muscle groups are groups of muscles[^3]. See this webpage on [Muscle Groups (National Cancer Institute)](https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/muscular/groups/) for more details.

### Exercise

A movement pattern intended to stimulate a muscle/muscle group. Some types of exercises include:

- Compound: An exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, like pull ups
- Isometric: An exercise that involves maintaining the contraction length of your muscles, like pushing a wall with maximum effort 
- Isolation: An exercise that targets a specific muscle groups, like dumbell curls

Additionally, exercises can be categorized by their aspect:

- Endurance
- Strength: Amount of force your muscles can produce
- Power: Amount of force per unit time your muscles can effect; akin to "explosiveness"
- Flexibility: Ability of your joints to move unrestricted and without pain
- Balance/Coordination: Ability to acheive a smooth, accurate, and controlled motion and/or stable configuration

Some broad categories of exercises that target some combination of the above aspects:

- Aerobics: For endurance and balance/coordination. E.g. running, biking, swimming
- Team Sports: For balance/coordination, endurance, and power. E.g. football, basketball, hockey
- Combat Sports: For endurance, strength, power, flexibility, and balance/coordination. E.g. MMA, Boxing, Brazillian Jiu Jutsu
- Resistance Training: For strength and power. E.g. weight-lifting
- Calisthenics: For strength, and balance/coordination. E.g. pull-ups, pushups, squats
- Stretching: For flexibility
- Yoga: For flexibility and balance/coordination
- Bouldering/Climbing: For balance/coordination, and strength
- Martial Arts: For endurance, strength, power, flexibility, and balance/coordination. E.g. Karate, Kung Fu, Judo

### Rep

A repetition of an exercise

### Set

A set of reps perfomed one after the other.

### Superset

A set of sets performed one after the other.

### Program

A schedule of various sets and/or supersets, geared towards a specific kind of exercise or specific aspect of exercise.

Typically, programs will be divided into days dedicated to a particular collection of muscle groups.
For example "Pull" and "Push" days, or "Upper" and "Lower" days, or even "Full-Body" days.
Just remember never to skip "Leg Day".
